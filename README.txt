Note: I, Kris Sosbe, have not been involved in the newer version of the app. Some of my code may no longer exist or may have been modified since I worked on it last. The code in this repository represents the project at the end of the semester in which we created it originally.

Invaders! is an Android app that was created for a class project in Systems Programming. We were given the ability to create any app on any mobile device as part of a four person team. It proved to be a useful learning experience for Android development.

In this project, I was responsible for creating the High Scores system (Highscores.java and ScoresServer.java) and handling some of the game logic (portions of playingBoard.java), including alien movement speed and health, score, scaling of drawables based on screen size, and level progression. A teammate and myself attempted to add multiplayer, but ran out of time and scrapped the idea. 

The high scores will not work in this version without changing server information, as the included server was meant to run on a specific computer in the Lawson Computer Science building. The server is located in the folder mysql-java and is untested in its location in the file structure of the project, as it was located on an external computer instead of the Android device.
